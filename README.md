- **Developer Experience**: Streamlined onboarding and reduced security friction for faster development
- **CIP-30 Support**: Full dApp connectivity with industry-standard wallet connector implementation
- **Network Support**: Mainnet and Preprod testnet for comprehensive testing scenarios
- **Transaction & UTXO Explorer**: Detailed blockchain data inspection tools
- **Multiple Wallet Types**: Create new wallets, import from seed, or spoof existing addresses

- **Chrome Extension**: Built and tested specifically for Chrome

## Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This wallet is designed with **reduced security measures** to prioritize developer experience over security:

- **Optional Passwords**: While we ask for a password by default, users can actively opt-out to reduce friction during development
- **Relaxed Security**: Loosened security constraints are intentional to improve development workflow
- **No Production Use**: This wallet should NEVER be used with real funds or for production transactions
- **Development Focus**: Security trade-offs are made specifically to enhance the developer experience

**Password Protection**: When a password is set, wallet information is encrypted. Password is required for seed phrase export if set.

**Data Management**: Users can delete individual wallets or completely wipe all extension data through settings.

üö® **DO NOT use this wallet on mainnet with real funds. This is a development tool only.**
